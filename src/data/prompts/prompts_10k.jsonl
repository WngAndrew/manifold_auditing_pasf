{"text": "Abstract: BitTorrent has recently introduced LEDBAT, a novel application-layer congestion control protocol for data exchange. The protocol design starts from the assumption that network bottlenecks are at the access of the network, and that thus user traffic competes creating self-inducing congestion. To relieve from this phenomenon, LEDBAT is designed to quickly infer that self-induced congestion is approaching (by detecting relative changes of the one-way delay in the transmission path), and to react by reducing the sending rate prior that congestion occurs. Prior work has however shown LEDBAT to be affected by a latecomer advantage, where newly arriving connections can starve already existing flows. In this work, we propose modifications to the congestion window update mechanism of the LEDBAT protocol that aim at solving this issue, guaranteeing thus intra-protocol fairness and efficiency. Closed-form expressions for the stationary throughput and queue occupancy are provided via a fluid model, whose accuracy is confirmed by means of ns2 packet level simulations. Our results show that the proposed change can effective solve the latecomer issue, without affecting the other original LEDBAT goals at the same time. Can the proposed modification to the congestion window update mechanism of LEDBAT effectively solve the latecomer issue without compromising other goals of the protocol? What evidence is provided to support this claim?", "label": 1}

Tough growing conditions on black \u2018Bay of Biscay\u2019 clay and minimal water produces small berries packed with ripe plum, blueberry and mulberry flavours. Our prized \u2018top block\u2019 grows at 25 metres in the shadow of Sugarloaf Hill. These younger vines span a sandy loam hillside scattered with rich alluvial granite and ironstone fragments. The Shiraz produced is elegantly cool climate in style with black and red berry flavours, layers of spice and complexity. Fruit from both blocks is high in demand and most is sold to Penfold\u2019s for inclusion in St. Henri or Bin 389.\nSelectively handpicked parcels from each block are pressed into traditional open fermenters and cold soaked (chilled to around 5\u00b0C) to maximise colour extraction. Primary fermentation on skins is followed with gentle pump overs and drain and returns to enhance the already abundant flavour profile. The Shiraz is gently pressed into barrel to complete malolactic fermentation then racked off lees and returned to oak. Unhurried maturation in the finest French oak for at least three years allows a gradual integration of fruit and oak characters. Bottling without filtration retains significant flavour and texture but sometimes also sediment - decanting is recommended. Extended bottle ageing ensures the wine is ready to enjoy on release. We expect it will continue to age gracefully with good cellaring.\nHow is the Shiraz processed after being selectively handpicked from each block, and what is the expected aging potential of the wine?", "label": 1}

The brilliant surfaces of the coated dishwasher racks are impervious to hot detergent solution and permanently abrasion resistant. They are also shock absorbing and noise dampening. Thus, dishes are preserved and protected, the coating will provide long-term reliability. For outdoor furniture, high weather resistance and low-temperature impact strength are a must. VESTOSINT\u00ae provides park benches and patio furniture with brilliant stainless steel-, aluminum- or copper-colored surfaces while effectively protecting them against corrosion. The permanently flawless VESTOSINT\u00ae coating also ensures that the view through the protective fencing mask is not disturbed. Here, the material scores big mainly because of its impact strength, which prevents small fragments from spalling off during a duel, and therefore prevents potential eye injuries. In addition, thanks to its mechanical strength, the VESTOSINT\u00ae coating contributes to the rigidity of the tight mesh of the mask. It is washable and resistant to fats and oils on the skin, sweat and saliva, as well as body care products. Because the material acts as an insulator, the coated masks are suitable for fencing with electric scoring equipment. Abrasion resistance plays a crucial role in the coating of shopping carts: In experiments simulating actual use, almost no traces of abrasion were observed on VESTOSINT\u00ae coated shopping carts after 250,000 test pushes with a full mineral water crate.", "label": 1}

The minerals, fibers, vitamins, and antioxidants end up being thrown out with the tea leaves.\nGreen Tea powder or Matcha, made from the whole green tea leaves is a nutrient-rich wholefood. It is rich in Vitamin A, B, C, E, Theanine (amino acids), Polyphenols, and dietary fiber, minerals as well. According to scientific studies, Green Tea powder contains 10-15 times the polyphenolsand antioxidants of regular teas, 2 times the antioxidants of a glass of red wine, approximately 9 times the beta-carotene of spinach. Based on the passage above, Can you summarize the benefits of consuming Green Tea powder and how it compares to steeped tea?", "label": 1}

{"text": "Given the text: Climate change threatens many wildlife species across the Pacific Northwest. As the climate continues to change, wildlife managers are faced with the ever-increasing challenge of allocating scarce resources to conserve at-risk species, and require more information to prioritize sites for conservation. However, climate change will affect species differently in different places. In fact, some places may serve as refuges for wildlife\u2014places where animals can remain or to which they can easily move to escape the worst impacts of climate change.\nCurrently, different datasets exist for identifying these resilient landscapes, known as climate refugia, but they are often not readily useable by wildlife managers. To address this need, researchers will map the locations of potential climate refugia for wildlife species in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. They will do this by synthesizing the existing datasets and adding in information on the locations of different species and their habitats. Researchers will work closely with wildlife managers from these three states, as well as with a broader group of federal, tribal, and non-governmental organization wildlife managers and planners, to select wildlife species of interest and design a digital atlas of climate refugia maps for each species of concern.\nThe resulting refugia atlas will allow natural resource managers and planners in the Pacific Northwest to identify specific areas where a given species of interest may be more likely to persist as the climate continues to change. This information can then be used, for example, to concentrate habitat restoration efforts in areas where a species is more likely to persist into the future.\nHow do wildlife managers and planners in the Pacific Northwest plan to use the information provided through the digital atlas of climate refugia maps for each species of concern?", "label": 1}

The utility of a standardized sensory-motor battery was investigated in regards to its ability (1) to determine what, if any, differences exist between ASD diagnoses or subgroups in both sensory functioning and motor functioning; and (2) to determine whether such discrepancies, if they exist, are capable of differentiating groups. Results from the quadratic discriminant analysis demonstrated that the factor scores derived from the Dean-Woodcock Sensory-Motor Battery significantly differentiated the ASD and nonclinical comparison groups. Factor 1 (Simple Sensory Skills) exhibited the strongest relationship, followed by Factor 2 (Cortical Motor and Complex Sensory Skills), then Factor 3 (Subcortical Motor Tasks and Auditory/Visual Acuity Skills). Findings from the study lend initial evidence of the use of the DWSMB as a potential measure to include within the two-stage diagnostic process for ASD. Use of the DWSMB as a screening measure may facilitate access to early intervention services given the primitive nature of sensory-motor tasks. In addition, the availability of the DWSMB as a standardized measure of sensory and motor functioning may promote increased sensitivity and specificity among diagnostic providers thus improving outcomes of individuals with ASD who can access services more readily with earlier, more reliable diagnoses.\nHow do the findings of the study suggest that standardized measures of sensory and motor functioning could improve the diagnosis and outcomes of individuals with autism spectrum disorder?", "label": 1}

In the proposed method, AHP is used to analyse the structure of the management selection problem and to determine weights of the criteria for each decision-maker based on pair-wise comparison matrix with uncertain data. TOPSIS method is used to obtain weights of decision makers (DMs). Final ranking is fulfilment by multi attribute group decision making (MAGDM) approach. A numerical example is examined to show the potential applications of the proposed methodology in the management selection problem.\nKeywords: MAGDM; multiattribute group decision making; management selection; interval numbers; AHP; TOPSIS; uncertain data; analytical hierarchy process.\nCan you summarize the proposed methodology for evaluating individuals as managers and its application in the uncertain environment?", "label": 1}

{"text": "Given the text: Highly crystalline hollow Y zeolite has been obtained by post-synthesis modification of conventional NaY crystals. The top-down transformation involves substantial dealumination of the zeolite framework by silicon tetrachloride followed by acid leaching and finally selective dissolution of the crystal core in the presence of protective aluminium species. The formation of internal cavities depends on the extent of dealumination of the zeolite as well as on the efficiency to remove extraframework Al species prior to realumination. Hollow Y zeolite crystals possess more or less regular internal cavities of ca. 0.8 \u03bcm diameter with external size and shape similar to those of the original NaY crystals. They differ from those recently reported in the literature by much higher Si/Al ratios, higher crystallinities and pure microporous shells of ca. 0.12 \u03bcm thickness. As a result of these differences, the family of hollow faujasites is significantly enlarged towards more siliceous and less defective materials. Their formation is most likely based on the presence of an Al-rich surface generated by NaAlO2 species during the last stage of the process, which protects the outer parts of the crystals from desilication.\nCan you summarize the process used to obtain highly crystalline hollow Y zeolite and the factors affecting the formation of internal cavities?", "label": 1}

Answer according to: Oxidation number, also called Oxidation State, the total number of electrons that an atom either gains or loses in order to form a chemical bond with another atom.\nEach atom that participates in an oxidation-reduction reaction (q.v.) is assigned an oxidation number that reflects its ability to acquire, donate, or share electrons. The iron ion Fe3+, for example, has an oxidation number of +3 because it can acquire three electrons to form a chemical bond, while the oxygen ion O2\u2212 has an oxidation number of \u22122 because it can donate two electrons. In an electronically neutral substance, the sum of the oxidation numbers is zero; for example, in hematite (Fe2O3) the oxidation number of the two iron atoms (+6 in total) balances the oxidation number of the three oxygen atoms (\u22126).\nCertain elements assume the same oxidation number in different compounds; fluorine, for example, has the oxidation number \u22121 in all its compounds. Others, notably the nonmetals and the transition elements, can assume a variety of oxidation numbers; for example, nitrogen can have any oxidation number between \u22123 (as in ammonia, NH3) and +5 (as in nitric acid, HNO3).\nIn the nomenclature of inorganic chemistry, the oxidation number of an element that may exist in more than one oxidation state is indicated by a roman numeral in parentheses after the name of the element\u2014e.g., iron(II) chloride (FeCl2) and iron(III) chloride (FeCl3).", "label": 1}

But these were also the years where I found beauty in maths, and formed deep attachment to the sciences and literature. So I am unconvinced. I think it's rebelling against the orthodoxy that education must be seen as a continuous stretch that is complete within a finite time frame, whereas it could be sporadic and episodic if that suits.

The poems here range from the eighth century to today, from Rumi and Shakespeare to Sylvia Plath, W.H. Auden to Carol Ann Duffy, Pablo Neruda, and Derek Walcott to Imtiaz Dharker and Warsan Shire. Their themes range from love and loss, through mortality and mystery, war and peace, to the beauty and variety of nature. From Yoko Ono to Judi Dench, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie to Elena Ferrante, Tina Brown, Michelle Williams, and Sarah Waters to Kaui Hart Hemmings and Joan Baez to Nikki Giovanni, this unique collection delivers private insights into the minds of women whose writing, acting, and thinking are admired around the world. Their selections include classics by visionaries, such as Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, and Pablo Neruda as well as contemporary works by masters, including Seamus Heaney, Adrienne Rich, and Warsan Shire, with introductions to their work as powerful as the poems themselves. Poems That Make Grown Women Cry is a collection which represents a variety of aesthetic sensibilities and the full spectrum of human emotion.

{"text": "Given the text: A completely different taste sensation from the Carrot Coriander Soup, this recipe is originally from Epicurious.com (I've modified it a bit) and has a wonderful apple flavour with a great texture from the crunchy almonds sprinkled overtop.\nCook shallots, bay leaf, ginger, curry powder, and thyme in oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until shallots are softened lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes.\nAdd carrots and potato or squash to the pot, then add broth, cider, water, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until carrots are tender, around 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Puree soup in 2 batches in a blender, or using a wand-style blender, until silky smooth. Add more water or apple cider if you'd like to achieve a thinner soup. Serve with a squeeze of lemon and sprinkled with almonds. Serves 3 to 4.\nNOTE: This is a very smooth soup, but if you like more texture, reserve some of the chopped carrots before blending the soup, and fry some extra shallots or onion in olive oil, and stir into the blended soup or dollop overtop (as seen in the photo above). To make it a larger meal, serve with bread, tomatoes and avocadoes, or a slice of frittata.\nThis soup is amazing! It's warm, beautiful, and so soothing. To suite my tastes today, I added a bunch of toasted cashews with the sliced almonds and a tablespoon or two of tahini, though honestly, the soup is divine as is.\nCan you suggest any variations or additions to make the soup more textured or to turn it into a larger meal?", "label": 1}

{"text": "An experience with the Holy Spirit or a dead person.\nIf the word \u201cMosaic\u201d is taken as being an adjective, it means relating to the religious figure, Moses. In the context of the poem, that could mean Dickinson is comparing the attire of the Ghost to the clothes that Moses would wear, as she says \u201cHis fashions, quaint, Mosaic\u201d.\nThat is my interpretation at least, as it seems to make more sense.\nOr does she mean \u201cI\u2019m never going to look back\u201d as in, I\u2019m looking only at the future and not concerned with the worries of death.\ni really like this poem it is cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!\ni felt that there were many interpretations to the poem. I feel that from the poem we learned a lot about about Dickinsons fascination with the afterlife, but I also believe that the ghost doesnt have to be taken on a metaphorical level. The ghost may be representing her father as he was the only real male influence in her life. As she lived in that big house for so long alone, she could be hullucinating also.\nDo you think then that it can be a metaphor for the mosiac of life? Life is like an intricate spider\u2019s web, fragile, beautiful, spun, but eventually broken (death)?\nTo me, this poem highlights Dickinson\u2019s obvious fascination with the afterlife. Not only does it portray the supoernatural as sensical, comprehendable beings, but encourages us not to fear death, or what may come after it. Dickinson does not try and indoctrinate us into one particualr viewpoint, but leaves the poem open for any religious interpretation the reader may wish to formulate. What does Dickinson's fascination with the afterlife suggest about her beliefs and attitudes towards death and the supernatural?", "label": 1}

But these medications have a serious side effect of decreasing bone mineral density and significantly increasing the risk for osteoporosis. As a result, ways to help patients on AED therapy maintain their bone health is a priority.\nA new study has found that high-dose vitamin D supplementation may be an effective way for patients on AED therapy to maintain their bone health.\nIn the study, researchers gave 72 adults aged 18-54 years on AED therapy and 78 children aged 10-18 on AED therapy either 400 or 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day (adults) and 400 or 2,000 IU per day (children) for one year.

His sighs \u2018did dry', and his tears \u2018did drown' the wine and corn, which echo in the bread and wine of communion. Wine and corn are also metonymies of plenty and joy, now \u2018all blasted/All wasted'. \u2018Thy death's head' is an emblem of conscience as well as symbolising deathward thoughts.

{"text": "Genesis is pleased to announce that Stephen Cooke will be speaking at the ISE Expo in San Antonio, taking place 20-22 September 2016.\nOver the past few years small cell deployment rates have been somewhat slower than initially forecast due to a number of challenges associated with affordability, location, site access, adequate backhaul bandwidth and power.\nHowever, in spite of the challenges operators remain committed to meeting coverage and capacity demands associated with continued growth of mobile data traffic due to consumer adoption of smart phones, wearable devices and the Internet of Things.\nIn order for Small Cells to proliferate as a viable solution they need to be affordable. They need to be inexpensive to site, inexpensive to backhaul, and inexpensive to power. The number of subscribers served by each Small Cell is low, perhaps 20, compared to the hundreds or thousands served per macrocell, making cost the critical factor as Small Cells still need a viable average revenue per user (ARPU) value.\nIn his seminar \u2018Aggregating and Sharing Legacy Networks for Integrating Residential Broadband and Next Generation Wireless Services\u2019, Stephen will present a novel solution to enable quick and affordable deployment of Small Cells, carrier WiFi and other services at locations where they are most needed; close to the home and place of work. Steve will demonstrate how the existing copper network can be used to avoid site access challenges, to provide adequate backhaul bandwidth, and to meet the necessary power requirements\u2026all at an affordable and viable cost.\nFor further information about Genesis please visit us on stand number 1117 or email contact@genesistechsy.com to arrange a meeting.

Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology. 153 (3): pp. 317-323.\nWe present here the first physiological data for the sandhill dunnart (Sminthopsis psammophila), the second largest (35\u201344 g) sminthopsine dasyurid marsupial, and report torpor for this species. Their thermoneutral body temperature (34.4 \u00b0C), thermolability below thermoneutrality (0.062 \u00b0C \u00b0C\u2212 1), and mild hyperthermia above thermoneutrality (35.5 \u00b0C) are typical of small dunnarts, and dasyurids. Basal metabolic rate (0.80 mL O2 g\u2212 1 h\u2212 1) is as predicted from mass. Sandhill dunnarts generally conform to the Scholander\u2013Irving model of endothermy, although metabolism increases less than expected and extrapolates to a higher than actual body temperature. Wet (0.22 mL O2 g\u2212 1 h\u2212 1 C\u2212 1) and dry (2.8 J g\u2212 1 h\u2212 1 \u00b0C\u2212 1) thermal conductances were as predicted. Thermoneutral evaporative water loss (1.6 mg g\u2212 1 h\u2212 1) was only 54% of expected, but this is not significantly different, and more likely reflects variability in the marsupial dataset than an adaptation. Relative water economy resembles that of other small marsupials, rodents and birds, with a point of relative economy of 18 \u00b0C. Respiratory ventilation closely matches metabolic rate, with minute volume increased at low ambient temperatures by increased breathing rate rather than tidal volume; oxygen extraction was constant at about 17%, except during hyperthermia above the thermoneutrality. Torpor conferred significant energetic and hygric benefits. We found no evidence of deviation from allometrically- and phylogenetically-based expectations despite the sandhill dunnart's arid habitat and large (for a dunnart) body mass.\nPlease summarize the physiological data presented for the sandhill dunnart in the article, including its thermoneutral body temperature, basal metabolic rate, and conductances.", "label": 1}

The AGNES Suit is helping MIT researchers understand the best products to make being 74 easier.\nThe number of people 65 and older is expected to more than double worldwide, to about 1.5 billion by 2050 from 523 million last year, according to estimates from the United Nations. That means people 65 and over will soon outnumber children under 5 for the first time ever.\nA majority of the population over 65 also means that there is a largely untapped market for products, technologies and even designer geriatric aids. Last month we wrote about Omhu, one of the first companies to specialize in making beautifully designed products that also aid every day life for older adults.\nA more reluctant aging population means that corporations are going to have to produce technologies that allow people to live the fullest lives possible. This means going a step beyond producing a wireless emergency button for those \u201cI\u2019ve fallen and can\u2019t get up\u201d scenarios. Devices such as a wireless smart pill dispenser to help keep track of medicines being dispensed or an anthromorphic robot named Celia, designed to allow a person to communicate with loved ones. While there is a long way to go in order to make the ideal scenario for aging become a reality, the opening of the marketplace and growing interest in concerns relating to the quality of life for those entering another stage of life means that there is room for large-scale changes in how we care for our elders.\nYou can watch a video of the suit in action here.", "label": 1}

The classic pin-curl set stopped at the crown, where the hair then evolved into a soft, bed-head-like texture.

Once the rest of the face was complete, Pecheux blotted off any residual balm off the lips before painting on the cream and drawing on the pencil.

Current solutions such as summarization are static and lack coherent organization. Even structured solutions such as timelines are inflexible. These problems become increasingly important as the size of the information grows. I propose a new approach to scaling up summarization called hierarchical summarization, which emphasizes organization and flexibility. In a hierarchical summary, the top level gives the most general overview of the information, and each subsequent level gives more detail. Hierarchical summarization allows the user to understand at a high level the most important information, and then explore what is most interesting to him or her without being overwhelmed by information. In this work, I formalize the characteristics necessary for good hierarchical summaries and provide algorithms to generate them. I perform user studies which demonstrate the value of hierarchical summaries over competing methods on datasets much larger than used for traditional summarization.", "label": 1}

These may affect various processes in the insulation system, including dynamics of charge transport and electric field distribution as well as its flashover performance. In the present study, the influence of macroscopic interfaces between layers made of high temperature vulcanized silicone rubbers on surface potential decay characteristics is analyzed. It is shown by comparing results of measurements on single and double layered samples that the rate of the potential decay may be significantly changed (increased or reduced) depending on how the layered structure is designed. The performed analyses show that the observed features cannot be explained by means of classical Maxwell-Wagner model and introducing additional charges at the investigated interface is necessary to successfully model the experimental data.

Although quite striking in an urban environment, large trees in particular present a continuing dilemma for the field of urban forestry due to the stresses that urban trees undergo from automobile exhaust, constraining hardscape and building foundations, and physical damage (Pickett et al. 2008). Urban forestry also challenges the arborists that tend the trees. The lack of space requires greater use of rigging skills and traffic and pedestrian control. The many constraints that the typical urban environment places on trees limits the average lifespan of a city tree to only 32 years \u2013 13 years if planted in a downtown area \u2013 which is far short of the 150-year average life span of trees in rural settings (Herwitz 2001).\nHow does the lifespan of trees in urban environments compare to that of trees in rural settings?", "label": 1}

Weanling C3H/HeJ mice (n = 48) were fed either a standard balanced mouse diet or a diet supplemented with 50 p.p.m. Zinc bacitracin (ZnB), with 50% (w/w) lactose or with both supplements. Eight mice from each group were challenged orally with a human strain of B. Pilosicoli (WesB), whilst four in each group acted as uninfected controls to evaluate the effects of the diets alone. The mice were kept for 40 days following challenge and faeces were collected every 3-4 days and subjected to culture and PCR for B. Pilosicoli. Feeding ZnB reduced total volatile fatty acid production in the caecum. Feeding lactose alone doubled the weight of the caecum and its contents compared with control mice, and resulted in a relatively greater production of acetate, but a reduction in propionate and isovalerate production. These effects were negated by the addition of ZnB with the lactose. None of the mice fed the standard diet or receiving ZnB alone became colonized following experimental challenge. One of the mice receiving lactose was culture and PCR positive for B. Pilosicoli on one sampling 1 week after inoculation, and one was positive on three samplings taken 20, 25 and 29 days after inoculation. All mice receiving both lactose and ZnB became colonized and remained so, with all samples being positive over the last seven samplings. The colonization was not associated with an end-on attachment of the spirochaete to the epithelial cells of the caecum, but colonized mice developed a specific humoral antibody response to the spirochaete.\nParaphrase the effects of feeding lactose and zinc bacitracin supplemented diets on the colonization of mice with B.

We hope you will consider these pages a useful, ongoing resource.\nThe Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 included the Job Corps, the college Work-Study Program and Head Start, but the following two year period also saw the creation of cornerstone programs such as Food Stamps, Medicare/Medicaid, HUD and others that today remain integral parts of the U.S. Safety net.\nThe War on Poverty launched two major health and nutrition safety net programs. The Food Stamps program (today known as SNAP) was established in 1964. A year later, Medicare and Medicaid were established as amendments to the Social Security Act. These are only two programs designed to combat the impact poverty has on health.\nResearch has found that education increases the chances of leaving poverty. Today\u2019s school poverty programs still include Head Start, which was an original part of the 1964 Economic Opportunity Act. They also include school lunches, Federal Pell Grants and other programs intended to increase access to education.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: What were some of the anti-poverty programs that were created in the two years following the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964?", "label": 1}

As a matter of fact, almost every product, process or system has the potential to be \u201cimproved\u201d so that the applications of optimization are countless.\nIn industrial problems, optimization is very often about the maximization of profit, productivity, efficiency and quality as well as minimization of time, cost, waste and risk. While the task of an optimization algorithm is to search promising solutions in an efficient way, a practical problem almost always requires a solution, or a decision, to be made for solving the underlying problem. In this case, the decision-making process, mostly with the involvement of a single or a group of human decision makers, is an equally important task as the optimization process. In other words, industrial optimization goes naturally hand-in-hand with decision-making support and decision analysis.\nThere are many exciting new developments, both in research and industrial practice when it comes to the interlacing of optimization techniques and decision analysis methods. To name a few examples: (1) optimization in a truly multi-objective context; (2) interactive multi-objective optimization to incorporate the preferences of the decision maker; (3) new software to support the interactive visualization of optimization data for decision analysis. While the course will progressively cover these advanced topics, it will commence with the general theories and methodologies in classical optimization models and modern metaheuristic algorithms.\nIn summary, this course will prepare graduate students to have the sufficient knowledge to follow the research frontier in the field of Optimization and Decision Analysis as well as some essential skills to solve real-world industrial-scale problems.\nHow does decision-making support go hand-in-hand with industrial optimization?", "label": 1}

{"text": "Could you continue the discussion on the potential clinical implications of the enhanced TS of the size of pain in older adults and suggest some possible future directions for research in this area?: Naugle, Kelly M. ; Cruz-Almeida, Yenisel ; Fillingim, Roger B. ; Staud, Roland ; Riley, Joseph L.\nTemporal summation (TS) of pain protocols typically involve the delivery of brief repetitive noxious stimuli held at a constant intensity and measuring the consequent increase in the perceived intensity of pain sensations. To date, no studies have examined the effect of a TS protocol on the perceived spatial dimensions of the pain experience and its interaction with age. This study used a new TS protocol that examined changes in the perceived size of the painful area in 22 younger adults and 20 older adults. Four trials of ten brief heat pulses delivered at a constant intensity were administered on the volar forearm. Interpulse intervals (IPIs) were 2.5 seconds or 3.5 seconds. Subjects rated the peak pain intensity (trials 1 and 3) or the size of the painful area (trials 2 and 4) after each pulse on a 0-100 scale. The magnitude of summation was calculated for each trial. Three seconds and 6 seconds after delivering the last heat pulse, the subjects rated the intensity or the size of any remaining pain (aftersensations). The results indicated that older adults compared to younger adults exhibited significantly greater summation of size ratings for the 2.5-second and 3.5-second IPI trials and size of pain aftersensations at 3 seconds following the 2.5-second IPI TS trial. These results suggest that aging is associated with enhanced endogenous facilitation of the perceived size of pain. The potential clinical and mechanistic implications of enhanced TS of size of pain remain unknown and warrant further investigation.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Purpose: The aim was to investigate mifepristone effects on endometrial carcinoma and the related mechanism.\nMethods: HHUA cells were treated with DMEM containing different concentrations of mifepristone. HHUA cells treated with 100 \u00b5mol/L mifepristone were named the Mifepristone group. HHUA cells co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-PI3K and pcDNA3.1-AKT overexpression vectors were treated with 100 \u00b5mol/L mifepristone and named the Mifepristone + PI3K/AKT group. MRNA expression was detected by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Protein expression was performed by Western blot. Cell proliferation was conducted by MTT assay. Wound-healing assay was conducted. Transwell was used to detect cells migration and invasion. Apoptosis detection was performed by flow cytometry.\nResults: Mifepristone inhibited HHUA cells proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with HHUA cells treated with 0 \u00b5mol/L mifepristone, HHUA cells treated by 50\u2013100 \u00b5mol/L mifepristone had a lower wound-healing rate, a greater number of migrating and invasive cells (P<0.01), as well as a higher percentage of apoptotic cells and Caspase-3 expression (P<0.01). When HHUA cells were treated with 50\u2013100 \u00b5mol/L of mifepristone, FAK, p-FAK, p-PI3K and p-AKT relative expression was all significantly lower than HHUA cells treated with 0 \u00b5mol/L of mifepristone (P<0.01). Compared with the Mifepristone group, HHUA cells of the Mifepristone + PI3K/AKT group had a lower cell growth inhibition rate and percentage of apoptotic cells (P<0.01).\nConclusion: Mifepristone inhibited HUUA cells proliferation, migration and invasion and promoted its apoptosis by regulation of FAK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

{"text": "At what concentration range of the ionic liquid does the motion of Li+ ions decouple from the segmental polymer dynamics, and what is the relationship between the viscosity of the ionic liquid and this decoupling? Answer according to: In this study, we have used nanocomposite polymer electrolytes, consisting of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), delta-Al2O3 nanoparticles, and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesolfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) salt (with 4 wt % delta-Al2O3 and PEO:Li ratios of 16:1 and 8:1), and added different amounts of the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazo- 0) hum bis(trifluoromethanesolfonyl)imide (BMITFSI). The aim was to m elucidate whether the ionic liquid is able to dissociate the Li-ions from the ether oxygens and thereby decouple the ionic conductivity from the segmental polymer dynamics. The results from DSC and dielectric spectroscopy show that the ionic liquid speeds up both the segmental polymer dynamics and the motion of the Le ions. However, a close comparison between the structural (a) relaxation process, given by the segmental polymer dynamics, and the ionic conductivity shows that the Motion of the Li+ ions decouples from the segmental polymer dynamics at higher concentrations of the ionic liquid (>= 20 wt %) and instead becomes more related to the viscosity of the ionic liquid. This decoupling increases with decreasing temperature. In addition to the structural. Alpha-relaxation, two more local relaxation processes, denoted)6 and y, are observed. The fi-relaxation becomes slightly faster at the highest concentration of the ionic liquid (at least for the lower salt concentration), whereas the y -relaxation is unaffected by the ionic liquid, over the whole concentration range 0-40 wt %.", "label": 1}

As one theologian put it, \u201cRemaining what he was, he became what he was not.\u201d Why did he do it?

The nearest anyone came to scoring was from a cross from Sefton striker Jamie Campbell, which was nearly turned into his own net by defender Lewis Connolly, but he recovered athletically to clear off the line.\nAfter good retrieving work and a neat pass from Chris Clarke, Alderson slotted home the first, almost straight from the kick-off after the interval.\nSeconds later, he was initially credited with the second goal. But Sean Smith&apos;s cross to the far post was adjudged to have crossed the goal line before he made sure.\nAfter this double whammy, Wirral gradually came back into the game. Craig McNulty headed off target from close range, after some fine wing play and a pinpoint centre from Craig Platt.\nWith seven minutes left, McNulty made up for his miss when he got to the edge of the penalty area first, after the ball stuck in one of the large mud patches, and slotted confidently home.\nThe expected Wirral grandstand finish never materialised as Sefton added a third from the restart. Jonathon Cahill sealed victory with a shot from 20 yards.\nGoals from Brad Shearwood and Ricky Vogel gave Sefton under- 15s a 2-0 win over St Helens in a match that switched from a Merseyside Cup tie to a friendly when the referee failed to arrive.", "label": 1}

{"text": "This composition of needs led to the development of Virginia Henderson\u2019s theory of nursing, which soon became known as the Needs Theory.\nHenderson\u2019s Needs Theory is based on an interrelation of concepts ranging from fundamental human needs, biophysiology, culture, interaction, and communication, whose purpose is to aid an individual in becoming as independent as possible. She also utilized and expanded ideas from other disciplines such as Abraham Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Human Needs. Maslow developed a ladder formation of needs ranging from the most essential to survive to the more primitive needs of self-actualization (Wills & McEwen, 2002). Henderson incorporated Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Human Needs with her ides for patient care, thus, creating the 14 components of her theory (Appendix 2). The first nine pieces of Henderson\u2019s theory are mostly physiological, or having to do with the normal functioning of the individual. The tenth and fourteenth consist of the mental features of learning and communication. The eleventh component encompasses the spiritual and moral needs of the individual, and the twelfth and thirteenth are geared towards occupation and recreational needs (Vandemark, 2006). Together, the theory's definition and 14 basic needs provide a logical and clear guide for nurses to reach the attainable goal of providing stability and gaining independence for the patient. While the theory itself is relatively simple, the organization allows generality and can be applied to the health of all individuals, old, young, sick, well, male, female, etc.\nCan you summarize Henderson's Needs Theory and its 14 components?", "label": 1}

It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it\u2019s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000.

This week it notched a sixth week atop the Billboard Hot 100. And a prominent feature on the setlist of Ari\u2019s Sweetener World Tour ensures that it is likely to remain on top for the foreseeable future. One of the trap-infused banger\u2019s defining characteristics is that it riffs on the mega-popular \u201cMy Favorite Things.\u201d The pop princess is an avid musical fan. Thus, the feature makes a lot of sense. But it turns out there was a hefty fee involved to secure those rights. How much? According to The New York Times, she agreed to hand over 90 percent of the songwriting royalties for \u201c7 rings\u201d to Concord.\nConcord owns the rights to \u201cMy Favorite Things,\u201d which was written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. The duo are two of 10 writers credited on \u201c7 Rings.\u201d So, the split leaves only 10 percent of the profits to split with the eight remaining writers. Allegedly, Ari\u2019s team accepted the deal mere weeks ahead of dropping the single this January. And she is not the only act to pay to sample music from the Sound Of Music soundtrack. Billboard noted Gwen Stefani sacrificed 50 percent of writing royalties for 2006\u2019s \u201cWind It Up.\u201d Considering both tracks\u2019 massive success, I\u2019d say it was worth the price.\nAre you surprised by the royalties split?

However, once the project gets completed, it becomes impractical to retain these resources as their skills are project specific making it difficult for companies to derive any value from these resources.\nRidgecone Technologies, one of the leading manpower outsourcing companies, helps get rid of these recruitment blues through its manpower outsourcing services. Instead of hiring new employees for completing project related tasks, companies can get highly skilled professionals without any strings attached.

Power and performance aren\u2019t strictly based on clockspeed\u2014the new processor has a clockspeed at least 1000 times faster than the original. But clockspeed doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\nOne common\u2014if imperfect\u2014way to measure computing performance is in millions of instructions per second (MIPS). Using this handy MIPS chart, we can see that the processor used in the original NES could perform 0.43 MIPS, while the processor in the Cortex A7 can perform 2,850 MIPS. By this measure, the Cortex A7 is more than 5,000 times faster\u2014we don\u2019t know the clockspeed so we can\u2019t be 100 percent sure the exact number. And remember, we\u2019re working with a four-core Cortex A7 on the NES Classic Edition.\nIn other words, it\u2019s incredible what Nintendo\u2019s engineers were able to do with so little computing power decades ago.

FDMA allocates a single channel to one user at a time. FDMA is wasteful of bandwidth: the channel is assigned to a single conversation whether or not somebody is speaking. Moreover, it cannot handle alternate forms of data, only voice transmissions. Qualcomm then introduced the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology to compete against TDMA technology to provide digital service. Now the two major competing systems (TDMA and CDMA), have been a topic for debate throughout the wireless community over which technology has the superior quality.\nIn TDMA, the access technique used exercises three users sharing a 30-kHz carrier frequency. TDMA is also the technology used in Europe where Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is the digital standard used to provide wireless access and in Japan where Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) is used as the standard. TDMA was chosen for these standards due to the reason that it enables some essential features for system operation in an advanced cellular or PCS environment. A single channel can carry all four conversations if each conversation is divided in short fragments, is assigned a time slot, and is transmitted in corresponding time bursts.", "label": 1}

By 1982, Chile had paid 12.8 billion dollars in interest and still owed money.\nThe extra 9 billion dollars should have been used to speed up Chile\u00a1\u00a6s development, but instead it went to countries that are already rich.\nThe only way for many LDC\u00a1\u00a6s to make enough money for their debts is to grow cash crops. Cash crops are grown to be sold rather than consumption. Cotton, Coffee, tea and tobacco are grown to sell to the developed world. Many people in LDC\u00a1\u00a6s are starving because land is used to grown cash crops instead of food.\nWorld poverty concerns us all as we depend on each other. For example, if we want the Sudanese to grow cotton for our clothes, we must make sure they have enough food to survive on.", "label": 1}

Specifically, Index replication method and no-arbitrage pricing model are examined. We compare the different combinations of ETFs portfolio in mainland China with W.I.S.E-CSI 300 ETF in Hong Kong in three aspects including liquidity level, correlation of ETFs with underlying index, and tracking error of the replication methods. Then, we add several new parameters into interval pricing model to obtain a more accurate no-arbitrage band. As a result, we found that the portfolio of SSE 50 ETF, SZSE 100 ETF, and SSE Bonus ETF could provide the best tracking effect of CSI 300 Index, with different weight as 0.369, 0.403, and 0.19 in turn separately. Furthermore, the new modified pricing model could find out more arbitrage opportunities than interval pricing model especially for reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage. On the whole, the optimal arbitrage strategy for investment on CSI 300 Index futures consist of two steps, implement ETFs portfolio replicate CSI 300 Index and using new modified pricing model to discover and define arbitrage opportunities then to apply futures-spot arbitrage. At the end of thesis, we also give a small case study to illustrate how to exercise the arbitrage strategy in realistic situation.

{"text": "Can you summarize the key findings of the paper on IL-6 and IL-10 signaling in relation to steatosis progression in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease? Answer according to: Steatosis, i.e., the accumulation of fat in hepatocytes, plays an important role in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It has been shown that STAT3 activation is involved in a decrease of lipid accumulation while C/EBPb is correlated with an increase of fat content and steatosis. Since both these transcription factors can be activated by IL-6 and the pathways leading to their activation are inter-connected, the relative activation levels of these transcription factors are likely to be important in steatosis. Furthermore, it is known that cross-talk exists between IL-6 and IL-10 signaling as both cytokines signal through the Jak-STAT pathway.\nThis paper develops a model for IL-6 and IL-10 signal transduction and then investigates the effect that stimulation with these cytokines has on the transcription factor dynamics. In an initial step, some parameters of a previously developed IL-6 signaling model are re-estimated based upon newly developed experimental data for the Jak-STAT pathway. Furthermore, the Erk-C/EBPb pathway is extended in the model to also include the dynamics of the activated transcription factor C/EBPb in the nucleus. Since IL-10 signals through the Jak-STAT but not the Erk-C/EBPb pathway, a model for its signal transduction was developed which includes interactions between IL-6 and IL-10 signaling as both mechanisms share signal transduction though the Jak-STAT pathway. Based upon the developed models, the ratio of the activity of Jak-STAT and Erk-C/EBPb was investigated for different stimulation levels of IL-6 and IL-10. These results will be used for the design of future in vitro experiments.\nC. Moya, Z. Huang, P. Cheng, A. Jayaraman, and J. Hahn.

The most striking feature on this seismic section is the velocity pull-up underneath the hanging wall. The pull-up is caused by thrusting of a sliver of high-velocity material over lower-velocity material, as shown in Figure 2, a velocity-depth model of the time section. Again, depth and velocity data were obtained from the nearby well and projected into the seismic section.\nThe fault at the left end of Figure 1 has some characteristics of so-called \"listric normal faults\" observed in thrust belts. It overlies a thrust fault ramp, dips in the same direction as the thrust, and curves slightly, becoming less steep with depth. In Figure 2, the normal fault is interpreted to cut the thrust faults. Another plausible interpretation is that the fault soles out into the thrust plane. Unfortunately, data quality is not good enough below 2 secs to determine which interpretation is correct.

{"text": "How does the steplike distribution of spin-orbit coupling in realistic devices affect the spectrum of Andreev bound states, and what implications does this have for the interpretation of recent Coulomb-blockade peak experiments mediated by Majorana bound states? Answer according to: Abstract: The Majorana zero mode in the semiconductor-superconductor nanowire is one of the promising candidates for topological quantum computing. Recently, in islands of nanowires, subgap-state energies have been experimentally observed to oscillate as a function of the magnetic field, showing a signature of overlapped Majorana bound states. However, the oscillation amplitude either dies away after an overshoot or decays, sharply opposite to the theoretically predicted enhanced oscillations for Majorana bound states. We reveal that a steplike distribution of spin-orbit coupling in realistic devices can induce the decaying Majorana oscillations, resulting from the coupling-induced energy repulsion between the quasiparticle spectra on the two sides of the step. This steplike spin-orbit coupling can also lead to decaying oscillations in the spectrum of the Andreev bound states. For Coulomb-blockade peaks mediated by the Majorana bound states, the peak spacings have been predicted to correlate with peak heights by a $\\pi/2$ phase shift, which was ambiguous in recent experiments and may be explained by the steplike spin-orbit coupling. Our work will inspire more works to reexamine effects of the nonuniform spin-orbit coupling, which is generally present in experimental devices.", "label": 1}

The combination of ketamine and medetomidine was tested in newly arrived macaques undergoing a period of quarantine in an animal facility. Results indicated that the medetomidine and ketamine combination induced a deeper, more level plane of anesthesia of longer duration than did ketamine alone. Furthermore, use of the medetomidine-reversing agent, atipamezole, permitted more rapid recovery. In addition, a preliminary study in adult rats was undertaken to assess tissue damage induced by intramuscular injection of ketamine versus the combination of ketamine and medetomidine.

This paper addresses the path following control problem of aircraft-on-ground and focuses on the task that the aircraft is required to follow the desired path on the runway by nose wheel automatic steering. The proposed approach is based on dynamical adaptive backstepping so that the system model does not have to be transformed into a canonical triangular form which is necessary in conventional backstepping design. This adaptive controller performs well despite the lack of information on the aerodynamic load and the tire cornering stiffness parameters.

Every 5 years or so, boys from the same age group (young teenagers) are taken into the bush for 1\u20132 months where they undergo several rites of passage into manhood. These involve learning certain survival skills, learning about women and how to be a good husband, learning about fatherhood, and also they are circumcised.

{"text": "Which SSM tool shows more consistent estimated measurements and captures clinically relevant population-level variability compared to the other tools according to the study results?: Abstract: Statistical shape modeling (SSM) has proven useful in many areas of biology and medicine as a new generation of morphometric approaches for the quantitative analysis of anatomical shapes. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in vivo images of anatomy has led to the development and distribution of open-source computational tools to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail and statistical power. Nonetheless, there is little work on the evaluation and validation of such tools as related to clinical applications that rely on morphometric quantifications for treatment planning. To address this lack of validation, we systematically assess the outcome of widely used off-the-shelf SSM tools, namely ShapeWorks, SPHARM-PDM, and Deformetrica, in the context of designing closure devices for left atrium appendage (LAA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients to prevent stroke, where an incomplete LAA closure may be worse than no closure. This study is motivated by the potential role of SSM in the geometric design of closure devices, which could be informed by population-level statistics, and patient-specific device selection, which is driven by anatomical measurements that could be automated by relating patient-level anatomy to population-level morphometrics. Hence, understanding the consequences of different SSM tools for the final analysis is critical for the careful choice of the tool to be deployed in real clinical scenarios. Results demonstrate that estimated measurements from ShapeWorks model are more consistent compared to models from Deformetrica and SPHARM-PDM. Furthermore, ShapeWorks and Deformetrica shape models capture clinically relevant population-level variability compared to SPHARM-PDM models.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Can you provide a summary of Devadatta's Poems by Beveridge and explain how it differs from historical texts?\nGenerate according to: Not that much is known about the historical character Devadatta, cousin of Siddhatta Gotama, the Buddha. Though much has been written about the Buddha, his shadowy cousin remains a secondary character throughout literature and historical texts, treated mainly as an evil and power hungry monk who attempted, unsuccessfully, to murder and usurp the Buddha\u2019s power. In Devadatta\u2019s Poems, Beveridge gives Devadatta a voice and a much richer characterisation, tracing his movement from ascetic devotee to jealous, murderous, and mostly ineffectual, rival. Although Devadatta\u2019s Poems has been written as a companion piece to Beveridge\u2019s sequences on Siddhattha Gotama and reading them together creates a wonderful balance between the forces of these character, it\u2019s perfectly possible to read Devadatta\u2019s Poems without reference to the other text. Devedatta, though not exactly likeable, is a compelling character\u2014enriched by his vast hunger, his aesthetic rather than ascetic perceptions, and the somewhat fun shadow he casts on his almost too perfect cousin.\nThroughout the book, the language is soft and musical, using a range of techniques, repetition, enjambment, varied structure, and rhythms to create meaning through nuance and motion. Those poems, like \u201cTailspin\u201d, that use shape create a sense of Devadatta\u2019s journey, taking the reader down the page in a way that can be twisting, circular, or seemingly random, with starts and stops.\nDevadatta\u2019s Poems is a delightful book of poetry full of the kind of mischievous fun that comes with exploring a fallen character: an anti-hero already relegated, historically, to obscurity. Beveridge\u2019s Devadatta is as compelling as he is repellant and his voice is one that will amuse, enlighten, and enrich readers.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Can you summarize the main point of the text regarding consulting fees?\nGenerate according to: If you follow the media, you\u2019ll sometimes see criticism of the \"enormous\" amounts spent on consulting fees. The media will gripe about people being paid $150 an hour, $1200 a day or even $30,000 for a month\u2019s work. They act as though these fees are just some sort of patronage payback. Of course, they might be right about the patronage. Politicians do like to pay back their supporters. However, the media are really making a mountain out of a mole hill.\nThat\u2019s because consulting fees are really about the value the client receives. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re paying $5,000 an hour as long as you\u2019re receiving something worth that much. And if you don\u2019t have the in-house resources to do it well, quickly or at all, then you\u2019re better off hiring a consultant.\nFor example, I recently struggled with developing a brochure to promote some workshops I\u2019m putting on. I must have spent 10 hours struggling with the thing. Sure, at some point in my career, when I was making $15 an hour, this would have made sense. But now I realize that I would have been better off to get a designer to do it for $150, so that I could avoid the headache and do other value-added stuff for my business\u2026like developing the workshops, which I can\u2019t really outsource. In the end, I asked a designer friend to come to my aid anyway. So I should have just spent the money in the beginning.\nAnd that\u2019s why it makes sense to pay megabucks for expert advice. It may save you money and help you do other value-added activities that make you money.", "label": 1}

This misleads consumers because it allows nutrition claims to be associated with products that are effectively empty of nutrients and overall, unhealthy,\u201d said Sinclair.\nSinclair said recent research showed that consumers believe low-carb beer contributes to weight loss and is a healthier option than regular beer.\nThe Coalition believes that information about alcohol should be spelled out on the product packaging, including a complete list of ingredients and health information.\nThis announcement comes after Coles released its own brand of low-carb beer into a market that is worth an estimated $600 million per year.", "label": 1}

Moreover, they anticipated that as criminals figure out how effective these devices are at keeping secrets, the problem could get a lot worse in the future.\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. Said that there are 175 Apple devices in the cybercrime lab, which investigators have no access to because of the encryption inserted in the state-of-the-art operation systems of the company.\nThe phones are warrant proof, he mentioned, and the powerlessness to access the data inside is especially a problem because most of the evidence once available in file cabinets is nowadays on criminals\u2019 smartphones.\nNumerous privacy advocates praised Apple for its encryption data, which the company markets as an essential privacy tool. Privacy advocates state that if the encryption would be open in Apple devices, it would open the possibility for governments to spy on users, which may result in abuses perpetrated by authoritarian governments.\nPolice Commissioner William Bratton said that criminals are becoming increasingly aware of of the protection Apple devices offer them. He also mentioned that a recorded phone call made in city jail showed that a prisoner believed that the innovative technology was an actual gift from God.\nOn the other hand, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that if Apple was forced by courts to allow the FBI to unlock a suspect\u2019s phone, millions of other people\u2019s phones may become vulnerable to criminals and hackers.", "label": 1}

This work constitutes the first step in the development of simple and reliable models for the mathematical description of the off-gas treatment of volatile organic contaminants in TLPBs. The model (based oil general mass balances and transport equations over off-gas rising bubbles) predicted a negative linear relationship between the fraction of organic phase and the logarithm of the pollutant fraction that remains in the gas phase The average relative errors of the model predictions were lower than 7%. Under the tested range of operational conditions (organic phase fractions and stirring rates ranging from 5% to 30% and from 100 to 300 rprn, respectively) the Maximum hexane fraction transferred from the gas to the liquid (aqueous + organic) phase increased at increasing stirring rates and silicone oil fractions up to 200 rprn and 20%, respectively.

How do prostaglandins regulate these diverse, cellular events? To address this question we have developed Drosophila oogenesis as a new and powerful model for studying prostaglandin signaling. Using both pharmacology and genetics, we have discovered that prostaglandins mediate Drosophila follicle development, identified the Drosophila COX1 enzyme, Pxt, and revealed that genetic perturbation of prostaglandin signaling can be used to exam the function of prostaglandins. This research on prostaglandin signaling implicates it in modulating actin/membrane dynamics, cell migration, stem cell activity, and the timing of gene expression during Drosophila follicle development. The lab is currently pursuing how prostaglandin signaling regulates actin dynamics and invasive cell migrations during Drosophila follicle development. By using a multifaceted experimental approach that combines Drosophila genetics, cell biology, live imaging, and biochemistry to we can begin to work out the mechanisms by which prostaglandins regulate these processes, and provide general insight into how prostaglandins regulate the cytoskeleton and migration at a cellular level. Such mechanisms of prostaglandin action are likely to be reutilized throughout development, including mediating the changes that occur during cancer progression and metastasis. Using Drosophila we have identified a number of novel targets of prostaglandins. We are now extending our studies to use human breast cancer cell lines to determine whether these new prostaglandin targets are conserved and the roles of such targets in prostaglandin-dependent cancer development, migration, and invasion.\nHow has Drosophila oogenesis been utilized as a model for studying prostaglandin signaling?", "label": 1}

The magmas in subduction zones are unique to Earth, are the most explosive, create the most valuable metal deposits, and produce the continents on which we live.\nGill is an expert on volcanoes and the study of how volcanic magmas evolve within the earth.

I\u2019d seen it on a blog somewhere and immediately thought \u201cO that looks fun.\u201d But as I googled puffy paint I kept coming across all these recipes that seemed far to involved to make when I could just go to the store and buy it. However, Quirky Momma to the rescue once more as I found the simplest recipe to follow.\nToday I\u2019m sharing my results!\nPer usual, I went right to Dollar Tree & Family Dollar to pick up these ingredients (i.e shaving cream & glue). There\u2019s no need to find the fanciest shaving cream you can buy because it\u2019s not going on anyone\u2019s face. Cheap dollar store shaving cream is sufficient.\nAs you can see, one of those bowls has blue paint; I dropped a few drops of food coloring in it to give it some zest. I made this paint at this particular time because my son had an I Have Dream Mobile project which included the usage of clouds. I figured why not give him something unique to decorate his mobile base. My nieces and nephews were visiting so we made the snowmen as well.\nIn all I\u2019d say making puffy paint was a lot of fun and there was minimal preparation or clean up needed.

Answer according to: \"Citric Acid Based Pre-SEI for Improvement of Silicon Electrodes in Lit\" by K. W. D. Kaveendi Chandrasiri, Cao Cuong Nguyen et al.\nSilicon electrodes are of interest to the lithium ion battery industry due to high gravimetric capacity (\u223c3580 mAh/g), natural abundance, and low toxicity. However, the process of alloying and dealloying during cell cycling, causes the silicon particles to undergo a dramatic volume change of approximately 280% which leads to electrolyte consumption, pulverization of the electrode, and poor cycling. In this study, the formation of an ex-situ artificial SEI on the silicon nanoparticles with citric acid has been investigated. Citric acid (CA) which was previously used as a binder for silicon electrodes was used to modify the surface of the nanoparticles to generate an artificial SEI, which could inhibit electrolyte decomposition on the surface of the silicon nanoparticles. The results suggest improved capacity retention of \u223c60% after 50 cycles for the surface modified silicon electrodes compared to 45% with the surface unmodified electrode. Similar improvements in capacity retention are observed upon citric acid surface modification for silicon graphite composite/ LiCoO2 cells.", "label": 1}

Answer according to: Tee, SI; Mart\u00ednez-Escanam\u00e9, M; Zuriel, D; Fried, I; Wolf, I; Massone, C; Cerroni, L.\nIn this study, we describe the clinicopathologic features of pseudolymphomatous infiltrates found within lesions of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA). We studied 11 patients (10 females, 1 male, age range 60-88 years). The diagnosis of ACA in all cases was confirmed by clinicopathologic correlation and positive serology for Borrelia. Histopathologic examination revealed prominent, pseudolymphomatous inflammatory cell infiltrates in all cases, with 2 distinct patterns. Eight of 11 cases showed a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate, exocytosis of lymphocytes and a fibrotic papillary dermis, similar to features seen in mycosis fungoides. The other 3 cases showed dense, nodular-diffuse dermal infiltrates with many plasma cells and without germinal centers. The plasma cells expressed both kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains with a polyclonal pattern in all 3 cases. In conclusion, ACA may present with pseudolymphomatous infiltrates showing both a T-cell and, less frequently, a B-cell pattern. These lesions need to be distinguished from a cutaneous lymphoma. In the context of the knowledge of Borrelia-associated cutaneous lymphomas, follow-up seems advisable in these cases.", "label": 1}
